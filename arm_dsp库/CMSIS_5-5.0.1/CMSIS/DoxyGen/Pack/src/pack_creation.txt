\page cp_Packs Software Packs Overview

The <b>CMSIS-Pack</b> format is used to deliver a Software Pack and is aimed to be scalable for future requirements.
It provides a management process and supports a tool independent distribution for:

 - \ref createPack_DFP "Device Support" for tool chains and software applications to target a specific device:
  - Information about the processor and it's features.
  - C and assembly files for the device startup and access to the memory mapped peripheral registers.
  - Parameters, technical information, and data sheets about the device family and the specific devices.
  - Device description and available peripherals.
  - Memory layout of internal and external RAM and ROM address ranges.
  - \ref flashAlgorithm "Flash algorithms" for programming the device.
  - Debug and trace configurations as well as System View Description files for device specific display of the memory mapped
    peripheral registers.

 - \ref createPackBoard "Board Support" for rapid development in the prototyping stage:
  - Information about the development board and it's features.
  - Parameters, technical information, and data sheets about the board, the mounted microcontroller and peripheral devices.
  - Drivers for on-board peripheral devices

 - \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Components" simplify the re-use of software and the management of 3rd party software. They contain:
  - A collection of source modules, header and \ref configWizard "configuration files" as well as libraries.
  - Documentation of the software, including features and APIs.
  
 - \ref cp_API "Application Programming Interfaces" specify one or more APIs for \ref cp_Components "software components" that are
   part of another \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".

 - \ref cp_Examples can be used as a reference and starting point for similar applications. They contain:
  - Fully defined application projects that work out of the box in the specified build and debug environments.
  - Documentation about the purpose of the example, how to build, configure and execute the application.
  
 - \ref cp_CodeTemplates help to understand the basic concepts of a software component better and to give the user a
   good starting point for implementing his application. 


\section PackFilenames Pack Conventions

All files that belong to a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" are compressed into a *.PACK file using a standard
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29" target="_blank">ZIP file format</a>.
The content of each \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" is described in the Pack Description (*.PDSC) file that is part of
each \b Pack. Refer to \ref packFormat for more information. 

\subsection pack_filename Pack File Name

A \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack" must have a unique filename following this naming convention:
<b>\<vendor\>.\<name\>.\<version\>.pack</b>.

\b Where:
 - <b>\<vendor\></b> is name of the supplier or vendor of the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".
 - <b>\<name\></b> is name of the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack". It is the vendor's responsibility to ensure unique package names.
 - <b>\<version\></b>specifies the version number of the \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".
 - <b>.pack</b> is the file extension identifying a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack".

\note
- The XML elements \elem{vendor}, \elem{name}, and \elem{version} are declared in the \ref Filenames "PDSC" file.
- \elem{vendor} and \elem{name} \em must \em not contain spaces.

The PDSC file needs to reside at the top-level of the Pack file, using it as the root directory for all file references.


\subsection pack_Cclass Software Component Cclasses

If you add a software component in the PDSC file, you have to specify a component class (CClass), component group (Cgroup),
and the component's version number (Cversion). For more information refer to \ref cp_Components.

If applicable, try to map the \b Cclass of your software component to one of the following predefined or already well
established classes:
- Board Support: Generic interfaces for evaluation and development boards
- CMSIS: <i>Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard</i> components
- CMSIS Driver: Unified device drivers compliant to the CMSIS-Driver specification
- Compiler: ARM Compiler software extensions
- Data Exchange: Software components for data exchange
- Device: Startup and system setup components
- File System*: File drive support and file system
- Graphics*: Graphical libraries for user interfaces
- Network*: Network stack using Internet protocols
- RTOS*: Real-time operating systems
- Safety: Components for testing application software against safety standards
- Security*: Encryption for secure communication or storage
- USB*: Universal Serial Bus stack
- Wireless*: Communication stacks such as Bluetooth, WiFi, and ZigBee

Classes with a * should always be used together with a \ref Component_Bundle "bundle" to avoid conflicts with other software
components.

If you wish to standardize a new Cclass, please send an inquiry to cmsis@arm.com or raise an issue on the public 
<a href="https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS_5/issues">CMSIS GitHub development repository</a>.


\section cp_PackSteps Steps to Create a Pack

The following image shows the basic steps that are required to create a Software Pack:

\image html PackCreateSteps.png

-# <b>Produce input:</b> Create the files that will be delivered with the Pack.
-# <b>Organize files:</b> Use directories to separate the content of the Pack.
-# <b>Create PDSC file:</b> The XML based PDSC file can be created using any text editor. Editors that can
   validate XML code against a schema file help to find bugs early in the Pack development stage.
-# <b>Generate PACK:</b> Any compression tool supporting the ZIP format can be used to create a PACK file. \ref packChk is
   helpful for the validation of the contents of a Pack.

The following pages will show how to create a Software Pack from scratch. The page \ref cp_SWComponents will start with a simple
Pack containing only the PDSC file and a single software component and will then explain further elements of a Pack in more detail.
The page \ref createPack_DFP adds information on the additional requirements that a DFP has, while \ref createPackBoard will
elaborate on the content specific to a BSP.


\section PackTutorials Pack Tutorial

The <b>ARM::CMSIS</b> Pack contains tutorials that are explained on the following pages. In the \b \\CMSIS\\Pack\\Tutorials
directory the following three ZIP files are available:
|ZIP File                           |Documentation        
|-----------------------------------|---------------------
|Pack_with_Software_Components.zip  | \ref cp_SWComponents
|Pack_with_Device_Support.zip       | \ref createPack_DFP
|Pack_with_Board_Support.zip        | \ref createPackBoard
